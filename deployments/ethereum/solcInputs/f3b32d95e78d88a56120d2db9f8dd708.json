Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

It is used to restrict functions so that they can only be called from one\n * account or list of accounts (EOA or Contract Accounts).\n *\n * The implementation of `AccessControlManager`(https://github.com/VenusProtocol/governance-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Governance/AccessControlManager.sol)\n * inherits the [Open Zeppelin AccessControl](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol)\n * contract as a base for role management logic. There are two role types: admin and granular permissions.\n * \n * ## Granular Roles\n * \n * Granular roles are built by hashing the contract address and its function signature. For example, given contract `Foo` with function `Foo.bar()` which\n * is guarded by ACM, calling `giveRolePermission` for account B do the following:\n * \n * 1. Compute `keccak256(contractFooAddress,functionSignatureBar)`\n * 1. Add the computed role to the roles of account B\n * 1. Account B now can call `ContractFoo.bar()`\n * \n * ## Admin Roles\n * \n * Admin roles allow for an address to call a function signature on any contract guarded by the `AccessControlManager`. This is particularly useful for\n * contracts created by factories.\n * \n * For Admin roles a null address is hashed in place of the contract address (`keccak256(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,functionSignatureBar)`.\n * \n * In the previous example, giving account B the admin role, account B will have permissions to call the `bar()` function on any contract that is guarded by\n * ACM, not only contract A.\n * \n * ## Protocol Integration\n * \n * All restricted functions in Venus Protocol use a hook to ACM in order to check if the caller has the right permission to call the guarded function.\n * `AccessControlledV5` and `AccessControlledV8` abstract contract makes this integration easier. They call ACM's external method\n * `isAllowedToCall(address caller, string functionSig)`. Here is an example of how `setCollateralFactor` function in `Comptroller` is integrated with ACM:\n\n```\n    contract Comptroller is [...] AccessControlledV8 {\n        [...]\n        function setCollateralFactor(VToken vToken, uint256 newCollateralFactorMantissa, uint256 newLiquidationThresholdMantissa) external {\n            _checkAccessAllowed(\"setCollateralFactor(address,uint256,uint256)\");\n            [...]\n        }\n    }\n```\n */\ncontract AccessControlManager is AccessControl, IAccessControlManagerV8 {\n    /// @notice Emitted when an account is given a permission to a certain contract function\n    /// @dev If contract address is 0x000..0 this means that the account is a default admin of this function and\n    /// can call any contract function with this signature\n    event PermissionGranted(address account, address contractAddress, string functionSig);\n\n    /// @notice Emitted when an account is revoked a permission to a certain contract function\n    event PermissionRevoked(address account, address contractAddress, string functionSig);\n\n    constructor() {\n        // Grant the contract deployer the default admin role: it will be able\n        // to grant and revoke any roles\n        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Gives a function call permission to one single account\n     * @dev this function can be called only from Role Admin or DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE\n     * @param contractAddress address of contract for which call permissions will be granted\n     * @dev if contractAddress is zero address, the account can access the specified function\n     *      on **any** contract managed by this ACL\n     * @param functionSig signature e.g. \"functionName(uint256,bool)\"\n     * @param accountToPermit account that will be given access to the contract function\n     * @custom:event Emits a {RoleGranted} and {PermissionGranted} events.\n     */\n    function giveCallPermission(address contractAddress, string calldata functionSig, address accountToPermit) public {\n        bytes32 role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractAddress, functionSig));\n        grantRole(role, accountToPermit);\n        emit PermissionGranted(accountToPermit, contractAddress, functionSig);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Revokes an account's permission to a particular function call\n     * @dev this function can be called only from Role Admin or DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE\n     * \t\tMay emit a {RoleRevoked} event.\n     * @param contractAddress address of contract for which call permissions will be revoked\n     * @param functionSig signature e.g. \"functionName(uint256,bool)\"\n     * @custom:event Emits {RoleRevoked} and {PermissionRevoked} events.\n     */\n    function revokeCallPermission(\n        address contractAddress,\n        string calldata functionSig,\n        address accountToRevoke\n    ) public {\n        bytes32 role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractAddress, functionSig));\n        revokeRole(role, accountToRevoke);\n        emit PermissionRevoked(accountToRevoke, contractAddress, functionSig);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Verifies if the given account can call a contract's guarded function\n     * @dev Since restricted contracts using this function as a permission hook, we can get contracts address with msg.sender\n     * @param account for which call permissions will be checked\n     * @param functionSig restricted function signature e.g. \"functionName(uint256,bool)\"\n     * @return false if the user account cannot call the particular contract function\n     *\n     */\n    function isAllowedToCall(address account, string calldata functionSig) public view returns (bool) {\n        bytes32 role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, functionSig));\n\n        if (hasRole(role, account)) {\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address(0), functionSig));\n            return hasRole(role, account);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Verifies if the given account can call a contract's guarded function\n     * @dev This function is used as a view function to check permissions rather than contract hook for access restriction check.\n     * @param account for which call permissions will be checked against\n     * @param contractAddress address of the restricted contract\n     * @param functionSig signature of the restricted function e.g. \"functionName(uint256,bool)\"\n     * @return false if the user account cannot call the particular contract function\n     */\n    function hasPermission(\n        address account,\n        address contractAddress,\n        string calldata functionSig\n    ) public view returns (bool) {\n        bytes32 role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractAddress, functionSig));\n        return hasRole(role, account);\n    }\n}\n"
