Added granularity to the pause control mechanism allows governance to pause individual actions on specific markets,\n * which reduces impact on the protocol as a whole. This is particularly useful when applied to isolated pools.\n *\n * The goal of **Governance** is to increase governance efficiency, while mitigating and eliminating malicious or erroneous proposals.\n *\n * ## Details\n *\n * Governance has **3 main contracts**: **GovernanceBravoDelegate, XVSVault, XVS** token.\n *\n * - XVS token is the protocol token used for protocol users to cast their vote on submitted proposals.\n * - XVSVault is the main staking contract for XVS. Users first stake their XVS in the vault and receive voting power proportional to their staked\n * tokens that they can use to vote on proposals. Users also can choose to delegate their voting power to other users.\n *\n * # Governor Bravo\n *\n * `GovernanceBravoDelegate` is main Venus Governance contract. Users interact with it to:\n * - Submit new proposal\n * - Vote on a proposal\n * - Cancel a proposal\n * - Queue a proposal for execution with a timelock executor contract.\n * `GovernanceBravoDelegate` uses the XVSVault to get restrict certain actions based on a user's voting power. The governance rules it inforces are:\n * - A user's voting power must be greater than the `proposalThreshold` to submit a proposal\n * - If a user's voting power drops below certain amount, anyone can cancel the the proposal. The governance guardian and proposal creator can also\n * cancel a proposal at anytime before it is queued for execution.\n *\n * ## Venus Improvement Proposal\n *\n * Venus Governance allows for Venus Improvement Proposals (VIPs) to be categorized based on their impact and risk levels. This allows for optimizing proposals\n * execution to allow for things such as expediting interest rate changes and quickly updating risk parameters, while moving slower on other types of proposals\n * that can prevent a larger risk to the protocol and are not urgent. There are three different types of VIPs with different proposal paramters:\n *\n * - `NORMAL`\n * - `FASTTRACK`\n * - `CRITICAL`\n *\n * When initializing the `GovernorBravo` contract, the parameters for the three routes are set. The parameters are:\n *\n * - `votingDelay`: The delay in blocks between submitting a proposal and when voting begins\n * - `votingPeriod`: The number of blocks where voting will be open\n * - `proposalThreshold`: The number of votes required in order submit a proposal\n *\n * There is also a separate timelock executor contract for each route, which is used to dispatch the VIP for execution, giving even more control over the\n * flow of each type of VIP.\n *\n * ## Voting\n *\n * After a VIP is proposed, voting is opened after the `votingDelay` has passed. For example, if `votingDelay = 0`, then voting will begin in the next block\n * after the proposal has been submitted. After the delay, the proposal state is `ACTIVE` and users can cast their vote `for`, `against`, or `abstain`,\n * weighted by their total voting power (tokens + delegated voting power). Abstaining from a voting allows for a vote to be cast and optionally include a\n * comment, without the incrementing for or against vote count. The total voting power for the user is obtained by calling XVSVault's `getPriorVotes`.\n *\n * `GovernorBravoDelegate` also accepts [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signatures for voting on proposals via the external function\n * `castVoteBySig`.\n *\n * ## Delegating\n *\n * A users voting power includes the amount of staked XVS the have staked as well as the votes delegate to them. Delegating is the process of a user loaning\n * their voting power to another, so that the latter has the combined voting power of both users. This is an important feature because it allows for a user\n * to let another user who they trust propose or vote in their place.\n *\n * The delegation of votes happens through the `XVSVault` contract by calling the `delegate` or `delegateBySig` functions. These same functions can revert\n * vote delegation by calling the same function with a value of `0`.\n */\ncontract GovernorBravoDelegate is GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2, GovernorBravoEvents {\n    /// @notice The name of this contract\n    string public constant name = \"Venus Governor Bravo\";\n\n    /// @notice The minimum setable proposal threshold\n    uint public constant MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD = 150000e18; // 150,000 Xvs\n\n    /// @notice The maximum setable proposal threshold\n    uint public constant MAX_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD = 300000e18; //300,000 Xvs\n\n    /// @notice The minimum setable voting period\n    uint public constant MIN_VOTING_PERIOD = 20 * 60 * 3; // About 3 hours, 3 secs per block\n\n    /// @notice The max setable voting period\n    uint public constant MAX_VOTING_PERIOD = 20 * 60 * 24 * 14; // About 2 weeks, 3 secs per block\n\n    /// @notice The min setable voting delay\n    uint public constant MIN_VOTING_DELAY = 1;\n\n    /// @notice The max setable voting delay\n    uint public constant MAX_VOTING_DELAY = 20 * 60 * 24 * 7; // About 1 week, 3 secs per block\n\n    /// @notice The number of votes in support of a proposal required in order for a quorum to be reached and for a vote to succeed\n    uint public constant quorumVotes = 600000e18; // 600,000 = 2% of Xvs\n\n    /// @notice The EIP-712 typehash for the contract's domain\n    bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH =\n        keccak256(\"EIP712Domain(string name,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)\");\n\n    /// @notice The EIP-712 typehash for the ballot struct used by the contract\n    bytes32 public constant BALLOT_TYPEHASH = keccak256(\"Ballot(uint256 proposalId,uint8 support)\");\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Used to initialize the contract during delegator contructor\n     * @param xvsVault_ The address of the XvsVault\n     * @param proposalConfigs_ Governance configs for each governance route\n     * @param timelocks Timelock addresses for each governance route\n     */\n    function initialize(\n        address xvsVault_,\n        ProposalConfig[] memory proposalConfigs_,\n        TimelockInterface[] memory timelocks,\n        address guardian_\n    ) public {\n        require(address(proposalTimelocks[0]) == address(0), \"GovernorBravo::initialize: cannot initialize twice\");\n        require(msg.sender == admin, \"GovernorBravo::initialize: admin only\");\n        require(xvsVault_ != address(0), \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid xvs address\");\n        require(guardian_ != address(0), \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid guardian\");\n        require(\n            timelocks.length == uint8(ProposalType.CRITICAL) + 1,\n            \"GovernorBravo::initialize:number of timelocks should match number of governance routes\"\n        );\n        require(\n            proposalConfigs_.length == uint8(ProposalType.CRITICAL) + 1,\n            \"GovernorBravo::initialize:number of proposal configs should match number of governance routes\"\n        );\n\n        xvsVault = XvsVaultInterface(xvsVault_);\n        proposalMaxOperations = 10;\n        guardian = guardian_;\n\n        //Set parameters for each Governance Route\n        uint256 arrLength = proposalConfigs_.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < arrLength; ++i) {\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].votingPeriod >= MIN_VOTING_PERIOD,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid min voting period\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].votingPeriod <= MAX_VOTING_PERIOD,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid max voting period\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].votingDelay >= MIN_VOTING_DELAY,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid min voting delay\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].votingDelay <= MAX_VOTING_DELAY,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid max voting delay\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].proposalThreshold >= MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid min proposal threshold\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].proposalThreshold <= MAX_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid max proposal threshold\"\n            );\n            require(address(timelocks[i]) != address(0), \"GovernorBravo::initialize:invalid timelock address\");\n\n            proposalConfigs[i] = proposalConfigs_[i];\n            proposalTimelocks[i] = timelocks[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Function used to propose a new proposal.

              "documentation": "@title GovernorBravoDelegate\n@notice Venus Governance latest on chain governance includes several new features including variable proposal routes and fine grained pause control.\nVariable routes for proposals allows for governance paramaters such as voting threshold and timelocks to be customized based on the risk level and\nimpact of the proposal. Added granularity to the pause control mechanism allows governance to pause individual actions on specific markets,\nwhich reduces impact on the protocol as a whole. This is particularly useful when applied to isolated pools.\n * The goal of **Governance** is to increase governance efficiency, while mitigating and eliminating malicious or erroneous proposals.\n * ## Details\n * Governance has **3 main contracts**: **GovernanceBravoDelegate, XVSVault, XVS** token.\n * - XVS token is the protocol token used for protocol users to cast their vote on submitted proposals.\n- XVSVault is the main staking contract for XVS. Users first stake their XVS in the vault and receive voting power proportional to their staked\ntokens that they can use to vote on proposals. Users also can choose to delegate their voting power to other users.\n * # Governor Bravo\n * `GovernanceBravoDelegate` is main Venus Governance contract. Users interact with it to:\n- Submit new proposal\n- Vote on a proposal\n- Cancel a proposal\n- Queue a proposal for execution with a timelock executor contract.\n`GovernanceBravoDelegate` uses the XVSVault to get restrict certain actions based on a user's voting power. The governance rules it inforces are:\n- A user's voting power must be greater than the `proposalThreshold` to submit a proposal\n- If a user's voting power drops below certain amount, anyone can cancel the the proposal. The governance guardian and proposal creator can also\ncancel a proposal at anytime before it is queued for execution.\n * ## Venus Improvement Proposal\n * Venus Governance allows for Venus Improvement Proposals (VIPs) to be categorized based on their impact and risk levels. This allows for optimizing proposals\nexecution to allow for things such as expediting interest rate changes and quickly updating risk parameters, while moving slower on other types of proposals\nthat can prevent a larger risk to the protocol and are not urgent. There are three different types of VIPs with different proposal paramters:\n * - `NORMAL`\n- `FASTTRACK`\n- `CRITICAL`\n * When initializing the `GovernorBravo` contract, the parameters for the three routes are set. The parameters are:\n * - `votingDelay`: The delay in blocks between submitting a proposal and when voting begins\n- `votingPeriod`: The number of blocks where voting will be open\n- `proposalThreshold`: The number of votes required in order submit a proposal\n * There is also a separate timelock executor contract for each route, which is used to dispatch the VIP for execution, giving even more control over the\nflow of each type of VIP.\n * ## Voting\n * After a VIP is proposed, voting is opened after the `votingDelay` has passed. For example, if `votingDelay = 0`, then voting will begin in the next block\nafter the proposal has been submitted. After the delay, the proposal state is `ACTIVE` and users can cast their vote `for`, `against`, or `abstain`,\nweighted by their total voting power (tokens + delegated voting power). Abstaining from a voting allows for a vote to be cast and optionally include a\ncomment, without the incrementing for or against vote count. The total voting power for the user is obtained by calling XVSVault's `getPriorVotes`.\n * `GovernorBravoDelegate` also accepts [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signatures for voting on proposals via the external function\n`castVoteBySig`.\n * ## Delegating\n * A users voting power includes the amount of staked XVS the have staked as well as the votes delegate to them. Delegating is the process of a user loaning\ntheir voting power to another, so that the latter has the combined voting power of both users. This is an important feature because it allows for a user\nto let another user who they trust propose or vote in their place.\n * The delegation of votes happens through the `XVSVault` contract by calling the `delegate` or `delegateBySig` functions. These same functions can revert\nvote delegation by calling the same function with a value of `0`.",

Variable routes for proposals allows for governance paramaters such as voting threshold and timelocks to be customized based on the risk level and impact of the proposal. Added granularity to the pause control mechanism allows governance to pause individual actions on specific markets, which reduces impact on the protocol as a whole. This is particularly useful when applied to isolated pools. * The goal of **Governance** is to increase governance efficiency, while mitigating and eliminating malicious or erroneous proposals. * ## Details * Governance has **3 main contracts**: **GovernanceBravoDelegate, XVSVault, XVS** token. * - XVS token is the protocol token used for protocol users to cast their vote on submitted proposals. - XVSVault is the main staking contract for XVS. Users first stake their XVS in the vault and receive voting power proportional to their staked tokens that they can use to vote on proposals. Users also can choose to delegate their voting power to other users. * # Governor Bravo * `GovernanceBravoDelegate` is main Venus Governance contract. Users interact with it to: - Submit new proposal - Vote on a proposal - Cancel a proposal - Queue a proposal for execution with a timelock executor contract. `GovernanceBravoDelegate` uses the XVSVault to get restrict certain actions based on a user's voting power. The governance rules it inforces are: - A user's voting power must be greater than the `proposalThreshold` to submit a proposal - If a user's voting power drops below certain amount, anyone can cancel the the proposal. The governance guardian and proposal creator can also cancel a proposal at anytime before it is queued for execution. * ## Venus Improvement Proposal * Venus Governance allows for Venus Improvement Proposals (VIPs) to be categorized based on their impact and risk levels. This allows for optimizing proposals execution to allow for things such as expediting interest rate changes and quickly updating risk parameters, while moving slower on other types of proposals that can prevent a larger risk to the protocol and are not urgent. There are three different types of VIPs with different proposal paramters: * - `NORMAL` - `FASTTRACK` - `CRITICAL` * When initializing the `GovernorBravo` contract, the parameters for the three routes are set. The parameters are: * - `votingDelay`: The delay in blocks between submitting a proposal and when voting begins - `votingPeriod`: The number of blocks where voting will be open - `proposalThreshold`: The number of votes required in order submit a proposal * There is also a separate timelock executor contract for each route, which is used to dispatch the VIP for execution, giving even more control over the flow of each type of VIP. * ## Voting * After a VIP is proposed, voting is opened after the `votingDelay` has passed. For example, if `votingDelay = 0`, then voting will begin in the next block after the proposal has been submitted. After the delay, the proposal state is `ACTIVE` and users can cast their vote `for`, `against`, or `abstain`, weighted by their total voting power (tokens + delegated voting power). Abstaining from a voting allows for a vote to be cast and optionally include a comment, without the incrementing for or against vote count. The total voting power for the user is obtained by calling XVSVault's `getPriorVotes`. * `GovernorBravoDelegate` also accepts [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signatures for voting on proposals via the external function `castVoteBySig`. * ## Delegating * A users voting power includes the amount of staked XVS the have staked as well as the votes delegate to them. Delegating is the process of a user loaning their voting power to another, so that the latter has the combined voting power of both users. This is an important feature because it allows for a user to let another user who they trust propose or vote in their place. * The delegation of votes happens through the `XVSVault` contract by calling the `delegate` or `delegateBySig` functions. These same functions can revert vote delegation by calling the same function with a value of `0`.\"}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol\":\"GovernorBravoDelegate\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"optimizer\":{\"details\":{\"constantOptimizer\":false,\"cse\":false,\"deduplicate\":false,\"jumpdestRemover\":false,\"orderLiterals\":false,\"peephole\":false,\"yul\":false},\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x4e6b3fa92820fa6f95d0f7dcfdd6ee4094a864b18509c575763cfd9f69e88ec9\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://4bc6bfb74d271bdee1d341a7f3ef2de0cc1aa48fe5e41754be7a5652cb156c97\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPAmzqXYtuhwJV9Xqaw4q9rF2dL3hjCtWziAnu2hKLZ4z\"]},\"contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoInterfaces.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa6fb55a269573ca355da6cffdc85acf37dbf3e3c3bd399c6d9116a9980102832\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7faec99dcebf2713b8f23e64322b1f9246b3514f8de47818134b082c746f78f9\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmU1wyx2fMWjGUfZTtsRkSDbFptAUCai4WcxcnpLtJGRvZ\"]}},\"version\":1}",
